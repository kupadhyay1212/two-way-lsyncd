Realtime File synchronisation between multiple servers in multi master mode
There is a good tool called lsyncd to sync files between multiple servers on real time basis. Here I have tried with two servers.

Hosts: Server1 and Server2

OS Used: CentOS 7

Install below packages on both the servers.

# yum install -y epel-release
# yum -y install lua lua-devel pkgconfig gcc asciidoc lsyncd
generate ssh-key in both the servers and add to authorized_keys file. [add public key of server1 to server2's authorized_keys and public key of server2 to server1's authorized_keys file]

Server1 configuration
Open /etc/lsyncd.conf and comment out the default configuration using -- at the beginning of the line and add below configuration to the file.
<< vi /etc/lsyncd.conf

settings {
  logfile = "/var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd.log",
  statusFile = "/var/log/lsyncd.stat",
  statusInterval = 2,

}
sync {
  default.rsync,
  source="/home/test/public_html/",
  target="server2:/home/test/public_html/",
  exclude = {'.env','test.txt'},
rsync = {
    compress = true,
    acls = true,
    verbose = true,
    owner = true,
    group = true,
    perms = true,
    rsh = "/usr/bin/ssh -p 22 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
  }
}


and save it.

Change the target IP in target parameter.
here the i mention the exclude files ('.env',test.txt) which i don't want to copy to target folder

You can change the delay parameter as per your requirement. Here it is set 1 second.

Now create the log directory.

# mkdir -p /var/log/lsyncd
Enable the lsyncd service to start automatically.

# systemctl enable lsyncd.service
Start the service.
# by more cmd u can see the status of lsyncd
more /var/log/lsyncd.stat
# systemctl start lsyncd.service
Server2 Configuration
Follow the same configuration as Server1 and change the target IP.
